# CS-Project_IR-PRS
Welcome to the Indian Railways Passenger Reservation System (PRS) Simulator! This C++ project leverages file systems, classes, and objects to replicate the functionality of the PRS system used by Indian Railways. This was a school project made in 2019 (12th SCIENCE).  NOTE: The code was written in TurboC++.

STEPS TO RUN:
-------------

Step 1: Open TurboC++.

Step 2: Load "PRS-CSPR.CPP"

Step 3: Check for the login password in the function named password().

Step 4: Compile and Run the Code.

NOTE: TurboC++ does not support namespaces. Opening the program in newer compilers may cause errors!

# CS-Project_IR-PRS
Welcome to the Indian Railways Passenger Reservation System (PRS) Simulator! This C++ project leverages file systems, classes, and objects to replicate the functionality of the PRS system used by Indian Railways. This was a school project made in 2019 (12th SCIENCE).  NOTE: The code was written in TurboC++.
